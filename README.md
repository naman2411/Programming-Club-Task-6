Vaibhav was crying in the corner of his room because his rating had dropped again. He notes down his rating changes on Codeforces after every contest. He wants to find out the index of the first rating drop in the array of rating changes for every subarray of size k. He needs your help to do so because his eyes are all watery with tears.  
**Input**
The first line of the test case consists of two integers n,k(1<k<n<1e5).-> number of elements in array and size of subarray.  
The second line consists of n integers seperated by a space.  
**Output**
Output consists of n-k+1 elements which are indexes of first negative element in the array for

that subarray of size k. (Use 1 based indexing) if no negative element is present in subarray output -1 for that subarray.
